# Routes
## Purpose
### Routes are responsible for defining the URLs (endpoints) that clients can request from the server. They act as the entry points for requests coming into your web application.
## Functionality
###  Each route specifies a path and an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). The route determines what action should be taken when a request is made to a specific endpoint.
## Key Role
###  Routes are essentially the "address" or "location" of a resource or action within your application. They guide the incoming requests to the correct controller function based on the URL and HTTP method.
## Summary
### Routes define where to go in your application (based on the URL and HTTP method), acting like the application's signposts.
